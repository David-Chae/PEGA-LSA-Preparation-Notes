Introduction to the Constellation architecture
- Client-Side Innovation with Constellation
- Development paradigm shift from customizing to configuring

---

### üöÄ **Overview**
Constellation is a new UI technology in Pega Infinity‚Ñ¢, designed to accelerate app development and improve performance. It introduces a **Single Page Application (SPA)** model and a **Center-out‚Ñ¢ architecture**, shifting from event-driven customization to prescribed design.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Performance Highlights** *(tested on Pega Platform‚Ñ¢ 8.6)*:
- **3x faster interactions**
- **7x smaller network payload**
- **10x faster initial server response**
- **30% fewer requests on first load**

---

### üß† **Client-Side Innovation**
- Built with **ReactJS**, Constellation uses a client-side engine to sync logic and data via APIs.
- Offers a full **OOTB UX library** for Case Management with improved accessibility (screen readers, localization).
- Views are rendered directly in the browser, reducing payload and speeding up interactions.

---

### üîß **Development Paradigm Shift**
- Moves from **customizing** UI to **configuring** it.
- UI elements like navigation and layout are prebuilt, allowing teams to focus on business logic.
- Early-stage configurations happen in **App Studio**, ensuring consistency and easier upgrades.

---

### üß© **Extensibility**
- Advanced developers can extend Constellation using **DX Components** and the **Constellation DX API**.
- Example: Creating a custom fingerprint capture field using JavaScript APIs and Constellation UI elements.

---

### ‚úÖ **Best Practices**
- Use existing **OOTB templates and patterns** for faster delivery and lower maintenance.
- Customize only when necessary for app-specific needs.
